C++ Dim Sums Game


Created a Dim Sums Game in which the user is shown four random clues and a sum. The aim of the game is that the user selects the two correct clues that add up to the displayed sum.

- Display four different random clues every time th program runs.
- The Program should be able to track scores and continue to run unless told otherwise.
- Use boosts serialization to serialize the clues from the original file to a new file.
- Use C++ to develop the game.
- Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 to develop game (can run in Visual Studio 2022).
